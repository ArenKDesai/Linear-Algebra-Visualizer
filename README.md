# Linear Algebra Visualizer

A Python module for visualizing popular linear algebra algorithms. 
It is suggested to import this module as something easy to import, such as ```git clone {this repo} linviz```

Ex:
```
from linviz import example

example(100)
```

This will print the numbers 100 to 1 in the terminal. 

## TODO
- Add functionality to determinant.py for recursively solving the determinant of matrices of rank > 2
- Add unit tests
- Flesh out the README.md with instructions on making new functions
- Add more functions
